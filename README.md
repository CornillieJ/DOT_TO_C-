# DOT to C# Class Translator

This small Python script translates a DOT file to C# classes. The script makes A LOT of assumptions about the layout of the DOT file, based on the HOWEST-provided files.

## Usage

1. **Drag and Drop**: You can simply drag your `.dot` file onto the provided batch (`.bat`) file to automatically generate C# classes.
2. **Run from Command Line**: Alternatively, you can run the Python script directly, passing your `.dot` file as an argument.

   ```bash
   python3 convert.py your_file.dot
After running the script, your generated C# classes can be found in the output folder.

Important Note
This script was quickly put together and makes a lot of assumptions about the input file. Please check each generated file thoroughly for potential issues or bugs. I am not responsible for any issues in the generated classes.
The classes will have no relationships, so you should still add implementation and inheritance of your classes.

Example

Hereâ€™s an example command to run the script manually from the command line:

```bash
python3 convert.py example.dot
```
Or simply drag example.dot onto convert.bat.
Enjoy your C# classes!
